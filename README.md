# Word Game
> This project is part of the course [Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/) from Josh W Comeau. The challenge was to create a clone of the popular Wordle game.



## General Information
- This project was meant to solidify the foundational understanding of React (thinking in Components, event-handling, managing forms, State management)
- Therefore the focus was mainly on building the logic for the App. The styling was already provided for the most part.
- I extended the scope of the project a little bit by converting it to TypeScript and implementing some small extra features (e.g., auto-focus on the input) with techniques I learnt later on in the course.



## Technologies Used
- React 18.2.0
- Typescript 4.9.5



## Features
- Guess a random 5 letter word by submitting it to the input form
- Indicate correct / incorrect / misplaced letters
- Display success / failure game outcome

## Demo
Live demo [_here_](https://genuine-lily-4496fb.netlify.app/).



## Setup
The dependencies which are necessary to run this app can be found in the package.json file.

1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the project folder in the terminal and install the necessary NPM dependencies
```
npm install
```
3. Run the app typing
```
npm run start
```
in your terminal and visit localhost:3000 in your browser.



## Learnings
- Composition of Components
- State Management (which component should manage the state, how to share it with other components)
- Typing props & useRef Hook
- Creating helper objects / arrays to re-structure / modify data



## Project Status
The project is finished.
